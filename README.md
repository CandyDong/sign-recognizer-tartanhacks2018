# Voco - the Sign Language Translator

Voco is an assistive app that can translate sign languages into words using data from Myo, a bluetooth-connected wearable armband. We built a classifier using an SVM (support vector machine) model implemented with libsvm. This prototype was able to distinguish 6 words (HELLO, MY, NAME, TARTAN, HACKS, WHATSUP). Speech recognition was implemented using Google's Speech Recognition API to help people who don't sign communicate better with hearing and speech impaired people.

This is a hackathon project developed during TartanHacks 2018 at Carnegie Mellon University. The team members are Justin Chu, Qingyi Dong, Bruce Liu, and Jacky Zou.
