# Voco - the Sign Language Translator

An assistive app that can translate sign languages into words using data from Myo, a bluetooth-connected wearable armband. We built a classifier using the SVM (support vector machine) model, and was able to distinguish 6 words (HELLO, MY, NAME, TARTAN, HACKS, WHATSUP) with this prototype. Speech recognition was implemented using Google's Speech Recognition API to help people who don't sign communicate better with hearing and speech impaired people.
